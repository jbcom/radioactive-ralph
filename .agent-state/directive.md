# radioactive-ralph — supervisor-architecture rewrite directive

**Status:** ACTIVE — never flips to RELEASED without an explicit manual "end the
session" from the user (directive 2026-07-17). The loop below keeps generating
work; the queue never legitimately drains.

## Directive 0 — the perpetual-shipping loop (ALWAYS ACTIVE, never checked off)

Standing mandate (user, 2026-07-17): "block on nothing. I want YOU making all
calls and working autonomously... always forward exploring with different review
skills and finding new polish and features that make this a better product until
I manually end the session. Until then keep mutating your loop and scheduled
reminder and directives so you're always shipping new PRs."

**This item is NEVER done and NEVER `[x]`.** It is the engine that keeps the
queue non-empty. Each pass:

1. **Ship the current concrete item** (the checklist below) to a merged PR —
   build → self-review trio (code/security/simplify) → PR → babysit CI + bots →
   squash-merge. Full autonomy: open PRs, resolve threads, and self-merge green
   PRs without asking. Design/architecture/packaging/naming calls are MINE; an
   AskUserQuestion for an impl/design detail under this mandate is a defect.
2. **When the concrete checklist is empty, GENERATE the next item** by
   forward-exploring — rotate through these lenses and append what they find as
   fresh `[ ]` items under "Rolling improvement queue":
   - comprehensive-review / feature-dev:code-reviewer on the newest merged code
   - security-scanning:security-sast on any new surface
   - code-simplifier on the largest / newest files
   - UI/UX pass on the TUI + GUI (run them, screenshot, compare to intent)
   - a NEW feature or polish that makes Ralph a better product (GUI richness,
     provider coverage, observability, DX, docs, perf)
   - dependency freshness + CVE sweep
3. **Compress finished work.** When a phase/effort fully lands, move its detail
   OUT of this file into the pillar doc `docs/superpowers/PILLARS.md` (one
   tight paragraph per shipped effort with the merge SHA + PR#), and leave only a
   one-line pointer here. Keeps the directive short and scannable.
4. **Keep the loop alive.** Re-arm ScheduleWakeup every tick; mutate cadence and
   the concrete queue as the work demands. Only a true blocker (interactive
   credential entry, a spend needing payment auth, physical hardware, or
   remote-state-I-already-triggered) is a legitimate `[WAIT-*]` yield — and even
   those route to OTHER queued work rather than halting. The user's SignPath
   enrollment is optional and NOT a blocker: everything ships unsigned-but-
   working without it.

Only the user typing an explicit end ("end the session", "stop the loop", "we're
done") flips Status→RELEASED and stops directive 0. Nothing else does.

**Original rewrite status (historical):** rewrite merged (v0.10.0). "Done" = every gap we identified + everything comprehensive-review / UI-review / security / simplification / bug-hunt digging surfaces is resolved. Drove a full multi-lens audit of merged main, then the desktop-app + onboarding effort.

Orchestrator: this agent. Executors: chosen per-task (haiku=mechanical,
sonnet=standard impl, opus/fable=hard reasoning) via Workflow fan-outs.
Each task ends build/test-green (branch is mid-flight but every checkpoint
compiles + passes its own tests). One large branch; final PR(s) at the end.
Full decision trail: .agent-state/decisions.ndjson. Spec:
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-supervisor-architecture-design.md.

behind any load-bearing call.

## Concrete queue (current)

Kept CURRENT each tick (do NOT commit this file onto feature branches — the
branch-switch churn keeps resurrecting a stale version; this baseline is synced
periodically via a chore/directive-sync PR, of which THIS is one).

- [ ] [WAIT-REVIEW] Async dispatch — never-block invariant fix — PR #127. dispatchWorker ran the provider turn (up to 5-min StallTimeout) INLINE under dispatchMu, wedging the tick/enqueue/reaper; the doc comment already promised goroutine-per-dispatch. Fix: goroutine-per-worker + maxParallel semaphore + shutdown-drain WaitGroup + baseCtx (async work runs under the supervisor run ctx, not the IPC request ctx that dies on return). Full suite + -race green. Load-bearing core change — address bot review carefully → self squash-merge.

## Rolling improvement queue (directive 0 appends here)

Next forward-exploration items:
- [ ] store: no db.SetMaxOpenConns — the SQLite pool is uncapped, so with _txlock=immediate every concurrent BeginTx races for the single writer lock, relying on busy_timeout(5s) as the only backstop under load. Set SetMaxOpenConns(1) (WAL single-writer pattern) so Go's pool is the serialization point. (Finding #2 of the supervisor/store review; lower-probability latent risk, verify current store.Open first.)
- [ ] After #127 merges, re-run a supervisor/store review pass to confirm the async change didn't open a new race, and forward-explore the next surface (provider runners / agent watchdog / TUI).

## Notes

- Model selection for subagents: haiku=mechanical, sonnet=standard, opus/fable=hard reasoning; reserve opus for <10%.
- Per-commit self-review trio (code/security/simplify) then fold findings forward; never amend a reviewed commit.
- CodeRabbit/bot rate-limit red check = false-flag; the signal is the review threads (resolve via GraphQL), not the check status.
