# Extended Agent Protocols — radioactive-ralph

## Architecture

Two deployment modes, same core:

1. **Claude Code plugin** — a family of 10 Ralph variants (`/green-ralph`,
   `/grey-ralph`, `/red-ralph`, `/blue-ralph`, `/professor-ralph`,
   `/savage-ralph`, `/immortal-ralph`, `/joe-fixit-ralph`, `/old-man-ralph`,
   `/world-breaker-ralph`) installed via `claude plugin install
   radioactive-ralph`. Each variant has its own model tiering, parallelism,
   tool allowlist, and safety gate. See `skills/README.md` for the full index.
2. **External Python daemon** — `ralph run` spins up an async orchestrator that
   survives context resets, process restarts, and rate limits. It spawns
   `claude` CLI subprocesses per work item with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
   and `--print`. Each subprocess is a stateless agent; the daemon holds all
   state in `~/.radioactive-ralph/state.json`. Config is pydantic-settings
   layered over TOML + env vars + CLI overrides.

Both modes share the same work-discovery, PR-classification, and forge-interaction
code, plus the same Ralph Wiggum personality module (`ralph_says.py`).

## State

State file: `~/.radioactive-ralph/state.json` (default) or path from config.
Schema: `OrchestratorState` in `models.py`.
Never store state in `.claude/` directories — they trigger security firewalls.

## Work priority

| Priority | Enum value | Examples |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1 — CI_FAILURE | Highest | Fix broken CI |
| 2 — PR_FIXES | | Address review feedback |
| 3 — DOC_SWEEP | | Create missing CLAUDE.md etc. |
| 4 — MISSING_FILES | | Missing CHANGELOG, STANDARDS |
| 5 — STATE_NEXT | | Items from docs/STATE.md ## Next |
| 6 — DESIGN_FEATURE | | Items from docs/DESIGN.md ## Features |
| 7 — POLISH | Lowest | Code quality, refactors |

## Model selection

| Task | Model |
|------|-------|
| DOC_SWEEP, MISSING_FILES | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
| Feature work, bug fixes, PR review | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| DESIGN_FEATURE, security, architecture | `claude-opus-4-6` |

## Testing patterns

- Use `pytest-mock` (`mocker` fixture) — never `unittest.mock`
- Mark async tests with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`
- `tmp_path` for filesystem tests, `tmp_repo` fixture for repo simulation
- Run: `hatch run test`

## Adding a new command

1. Add a Click command to `cli.py`
2. Add the underlying logic to the appropriate module
3. Add a test in `tests/`
4. Update `docs/STATE.md`

## PR workflow

- Work on branches, open PRs, merge via GitHub
- All PRs need tests and passing CI before merge
- Use squash merge
